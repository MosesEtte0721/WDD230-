        <div class="history"> <h3>History</h3> <p> Eket is Local Government and town in Akwa Ibom, Nigeria.
            The Ekid (Eket) are the people who live in this Local Government Area. 
            They are a sub-group of the Ibibio people. Ekid is also the name of the main sub-language that they speak, a Benue–Congo language. 
            Both languages are similar, but sufficiently distinct to give away the precise district the speaker originates from.</p>
           
            <p>Just like the rest of West Africa, 
                the family name normally is an indicator of which specific region one is from.
                Common surnames include Odungide, Akanimo, Assam, Inwang, Essiet, Udoito, Edoho, 
                Edohoeket, Etukudo, Ukpong, Abia, Ekpo, Ikott, Abasekong, Asamudo, Nyoho, Ekong, 
                Ekanim, Udofa, Edem, Inyang, Itauma, Udosen, Usoro, Etti, 
                Ette (father), Udofia, Ukoetuk, Uku, Abia and Nsien. 
                </p>
            
            <p>Some ideas about the history of Eket 
            people before the colonial era can be gleaned from the oral 
            histories of the different Ekid clans. 
            There are three recognized Ekid clans, namely Ekid Afaha, Ekid Offiong and Idua clans. The fourth clan in Eket Local Government Area is Okon clan. 
            These different clans of Eket people have their oral histories 
            explaining their origin and migration to their present locations. 
            Common among the oral histories of migration of Eket Afaha and Ekid Offiong clans is the fact that they migrated from Usak Edet (Isangele) 
            in the present-day Cameroon through various routes to their current locations. 
            The Idua people claim they migrated from the Cameroons to Calabar through Northern Cross River before crossing to Esit Eket, Eket and Oron on the mainland. 
            These oral histories seem to confirm the position of several historians such as Abasiattai (1988)and Edet Udoh (1983)that Eket, Oron and Ibeno people migrated through 
            a seaward route from the Cameroons to their current locations.</p>
            
            <p>The next major historical event was the arrival of the Rev. 
            Samuel Bill at Ibeno in December 1887 at the request of Ibeno chiefs to establish a Christian Mission in the area.
            Through the establishment of the Qua Iboe Mission, 
            Christianity and western education were brought to Ibeno, Eket, 
            Etinan and from there Christianity and education spread to other parts of Ibibio and Ibo lands and beyond.
